## #OneDevCommunity

#OneDevCommunity is a hashtag initiative that brings developer communities, worldwide, together to support each other during this time of crisis. We are all feeling _something_ right now and how we address those feelings matters. #OneDevCommunity brings developers (and aspiring developers) together to listen, respond & support our fellow community members in any way we can.

_How are you feeling today? How do you think your fellow peers are feeling? What is something you can do today to help a fellow community member out?_

### Community Managers & Leaders Unite

We all lead or work with developer communities in our day-to-day jobs. It’s nearly impossible to push any business-focused content right now and feel okay doing so. We would like to recommend that we use some of our energy to focus on our wider developer community as a whole. 

**Ask** developers how they are feeling.

**Respond** with empathy, resources and helpful advice

**Support** other ways to help within our group of community leaders & beyond

**Repeat**

There are likely to be a variety of responses from this initiative, including:

*   I lost my job or I can’t work right now (financial stress)
*   I can’t work right now, but I am covered financially (Might be looking to learn something new or help others)
*   I am just struggling emotionally or mentally (mental health)
*   I feel helpless (likely looking to help community members)

As a community, we can provide words-of-kindness, resources or options to solve some of these problems (maybe we have roles to hire or maybe we have a mental health profession on-staff that can host a Q&A or webinar). And hopefully our example will cause developers to begin to help other developers, all through a single hashtag.

### What’s Next
1. Join the community initiative. Share your information here and we'll add you to the growing collaborator community. [https://forms.gle/Xg5Dis1LRRzs6SsX9](https://forms.gle/Xg5Dis1LRRzs6SsX9) 
2. Attend an upcoming working session where we can collaborate and discuss the vision and share new ideas to make this 100 times better. 
3. Start using the hashtag, #OneDevCommunity, in your community mediums and publicly through social media, online communities and whatever else that developers are getting together. Share the project description (first paragraph of doc) or rewrite the project description in your own words. Start applying the hashtag to every thread you see where it can bring awareness. 
4. Continue to collaborate, we're considering creating a daily "stand-up" for collaborators to work together for all of us involved so that we can work together to address common needs as #OneDevCommunity. ❤️

### Disclaimer

There is no business value, per say, in this initiative. The intent and goal is to just be there for our community members. There may be opportunities for us to push our own business goals and I would strongly recommend that we avoid doing this. Consider this a good-will project that will hopefully build strong bonds between our companies, our community members and the wider developer community.
